## 🚀 Future Development Roadmap

## 📈 Standards & Roadmap: CVSS and Blockchain CVEs

DVulnDB is committed to supporting industry-standard vulnerability scoring and next-generation security data storage. The following initiatives are planned:

### CVSS 4.0 & 3.0 Support

- Full support for both CVSS 4.0 and 3.0 scoring systems.
- No proprietary or custom scoring algorithms—only official standards will be used.
- CVSS metrics will be parsed, displayed, and searchable within the platform.

### Blockchain-Native CVE Storage

- Vulnerability records (CVEs) will be stored directly on the blockchain for immutability and transparency.
- CVSS scores and vectors will be stored as part of the on-chain record.
- The platform will not invent its own scoring system; it will leverage existing standards for maximum compatibility and trust.

These features will ensure DVulnDB remains interoperable with the global security ecosystem and trusted by researchers, vendors, and enterprises alike.

## 🔗 Blockchain CVE Severity Scale (Hacken Methodology)

DVulnDB supports blockchain-specific CVEs and severity scoring, following the Hacken methodology as described in [Hacken Pentesting Methodology](https://docs.hacken.io/methodologies/pentesting/#06-severity-scoring-scale). This approach combines exploitation difficulty and access level to determine severity, and maps directly to CVSS for global compatibility.

### Severity Matrix

|                   | Insignificant | Moderately Significant | Significant |
|-------------------|:------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------:|
| **High Difficulty**   | Low          | Medium                | Medium      |
| **Medium Difficulty** | Low          | Medium                | High        |
| **Low Difficulty**    | Low          | High                  | Critical    |

- **Y-axis:** Exploitation Difficulty (High, Medium, Low)
- **X-axis:** Level of Access to Enterprise or End-User Information or Systems (Insignificant, Moderately Significant, Significant)

### Severity Levels and CVSS Mapping

| Severity     | CVSS Range   | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Informational| -            | Does not pose an immediate risk; provides system insights for improvement. |
| Low          | 0.1 - 3.9    | Low risk, low access. Easier to exploit but limited impact. |
| Medium       | 4.0 - 6.9    | Moderate difficulty or access. Greater risk than low, but not severe. |
| High         | 7.0 - 8.9    | Low difficulty, higher access. Significant risk, requires immediate attention. |
| Critical     | 9.0 - 10.0   | Low difficulty, highest access. Most severe, urgent remediation needed. |

**Key Points:**

- DVulnDB will store both the Hacken-style severity and the official CVSS score/vector on-chain.
- No custom scoring will be invented; all mappings use industry standards for maximum transparency and prioritization.
- This ensures blockchain-level CVEs are compatible with global security best practices and easily prioritized by defenders.
