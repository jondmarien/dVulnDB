# Progress Summary: June 17, 2025

Today's session focused on migrating the wallet functionality to Reown AppKit and implementing a responsive navigation menu.

## Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Reown AppKit Migration (Phase 1 Complete):**
    *   Removed legacy `@solana/wallet-adapter-*` packages.
    *   Installed `@reown/appkit`, `@reown/appkit-adapter-solana`, and related dependencies.
    *   Created and integrated `AppKitProviderWrapper.tsx` to initialize AppKit with the project ID.
    *   Replaced the old wallet button with `<appkit-button />` in the `Header`.

2.  **UI & Styling:**
    *   Applied a custom "hacker terminal" theme to the `<appkit-button>` and its modal using AppKit's `themeVariables` and global CSS overrides. The button now has sharp corners and a neon green glow.
    *   Refactored the `Landing` and `ProtectedRoute` components to use the `useAppKitAccount` hook for checking connection status, removing legacy `useWallet` dependencies.

3.  **Responsive Navigation (Hamburger Menu):**
    *   Created a new `HamburgerMenu.tsx` component with state management for toggling the menu.
    *   Added extensive CSS to `globals.css` to style the hamburger icon and the full-screen slide-in overlay with the neon terminal theme.
    *   Integrated the `<HamburgerMenu />` into the `Header.tsx` component.
    *   Added responsive media queries to hide the standard desktop navigation and show the hamburger menu on mobile screens.

## Current Focus & Next Steps:

We are currently debugging two issues that appeared after the latest implementations:

1.  **Hamburger Menu Visibility:** The hamburger icon is not appearing on mobile viewports as expected.
2.  **AppKit Mobile Error:** When connecting a wallet on mobile, a toast notification appears with an "Invalid app configuration" error, although the connection seems to succeed.

The immediate plan is to resolve the CSS issue with the hamburger menu and then investigate the AppKit configuration to fix the mobile error.

4.  **Connect Wallet Button Redesign:**
    *   Overhauled the `<appkit-button>` to match a terminal command aesthetic.
    *   Removed the default pill shape and background, replacing it with a transparent background and a sharp, glowing green border.
    *   Used CSS pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) to set the button text to `> connect --wallet`, ensuring the text is not selectable and part of the style.
    *   Imported and applied the "JetBrains Mono" font to the button for an authentic terminal look.
    *   The button now has a hover effect that intensifies the glow, enhancing the interactive feel.
