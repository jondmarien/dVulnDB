# DVulnDB

Decentralized Vulnerability Database & Bug Bounty Platform

---

DVulnDB is a next-generation, blockchain-powered vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty platform for cybersecurity professionals. It combines industry-standard CVSS scoring (4.0/3.0), blockchain-native CVE storage, cyberpunk UI, and seamless wallet integration to deliver a transparent, tamper-proof, and community-driven security ecosystem.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Decentralized CVE Registry:** Store vulnerability records (CVEs) and their CVSS scores directly on-chain for transparency and immutability.
- **CVSS 4.0 & 3.0 Support:** Full support for official Common Vulnerability Scoring System standards. No custom scoring‚Äîonly industry standards.
- **Blockchain-Native Severity Matrix:** Hacken-style severity mapped to CVSS for blockchain-specific findings.
- **Wallet Integration:** Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet for authentication and rewards.
- **Bug Bounty Automation:** Smart contract escrow, multi-sig validation, and automatic reward payouts.
- **Cyberpunk UI:** Matrix-inspired, high-contrast design with animated backgrounds and terminal vibes.
- **Tooling & API:** Upload outputs from Nmap, Nikto, Burp Suite, or use our PowerShell module for automated submissions.
- **Community & Reputation:** NFT-based researcher profiles, leaderboards, and transparent validation/voting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Web3:** Wagmi v2, Viem, Web3Modal
- **Smart Contracts:** Solana (simulated; mainnet support planned)
- **Storage:** IPFS for decentralized file storage
