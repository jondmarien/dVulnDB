# Solana/Anchor Best Practice Checklist for DVulnDB

This checklist is designed to help ensure your Solana dApp (with Anchor framework and Next.js frontend) is production-ready, secure, and maintainable. Use it as a living document for your team.

---

## 1. Project Structure
- [ ] `anchor/` directory (or `programs/` for Anchor projects)
- [ ] `Anchor.toml` config file at repo root or in anchor dir
- [ ] `programs/your_program/` with `src/lib.rs` (main contract logic)
- [ ] `tests/` directory for integration tests
- [ ] `migrations/` for deployment scripts (if needed)
- [ ] `target/` and `idls/` (auto-generated)
- [ ] Frontend (e.g., `app/` or `src/` for Next.js)
- [ ] Clear repo tree in README

## 2. Smart Contract (Anchor) Setup
- [ ] Rust smart contract(s) implemented in `programs/`
- [ ] All instructions, accounts, and errors documented (inline + docs)
- [ ] Anchor IDL generated and committed for frontend use
- [ ] Program ID(s) tracked for each environment (localnet/devnet/mainnet)
- [ ] Use Anchor features: accounts, instructions, events, error codes
- [ ] Security reviewed: no unchecked account access, proper validation

## 3. Configuration & Environment
- [ ] `.env.example` provided (RPC URL, program IDs, etc.)
- [ ] `Anchor.toml` with correct cluster & wallet config
- [ ] Frontend config for connecting to Solana cluster
- [ ] Document how to set up local wallet/keypair

## 4. Build, Test, and Deploy
- [ ] Anchor CLI and Solana CLI install instructions in README
- [ ] `anchor build` and `anchor test` pass locally
- [ ] Integration tests for all contract instructions
- [ ] Frontend: `npm run build` and `npm run dev` work out of the box
- [ ] Deployment steps for both contracts and frontend documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for auto-build/test/deploy (optional but recommended)

## 5. Wallet Integration
- [ ] Phantom wallet (and/or other wallet adapters) integrated
- [ ] Mock wallet support for local development/testing
- [ ] Wallet connection UX tested (real and mock)
- [ ] Error handling for wallet/network issues

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] High-level project overview in README
- [ ] Detailed setup, build, test, deploy instructions
- [ ] Smart contract docs: instructions, accounts, errors, IDL usage
- [ ] Frontend docs: architecture, wallet connection, Solana integration
- [ ] Contribution guidelines and code of conduct

## 7. Security & Best Practices
- [ ] Accounts validated in every instruction
- [ ] No unchecked cross-program invocations
- [ ] Proper use of seeds and PDAs
- [ ] Error handling and custom error codes
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code or config
- [ ] Use of Solana/Anchor security linting tools
- [ ] Regular audits and code reviews

## 8. Advanced (Optional)
- [ ] Multi-signature validation support
- [ ] IPFS or decentralized storage integration
- [ ] Reputation/staking mechanisms
- [ ] Analytics and reporting
- [ ] Cross-chain or future-proofing features

## Recommended Next Actions for DVulnDB

1. **Add Smart Contract Source/Anchor Directory:**
   - If not present, scaffold Anchor program and commit contract source, IDL, and config.
2. **Document Repo Structure:**
   - Add a repo tree and clarify where contracts, frontend, and docs live.
3. **Expand Build/Deploy/Test Instructions:**
   - Include Anchor/Solana CLI setup, contract build/test/deploy, and frontend instructions.
4. **Add .env.example:**
   - Document all required environment variables.
5. **Improve Smart Contract Docs:**
   - Document each instruction, account, and error code (in code and docs).
6. **Add/Document Tests:**
   - Ensure both contract and frontend have tests and instructions to run them.
7. **CI/CD:**
   - Set up CI for auto-build/test/deploy if not done.
8. **Security Review:**
   - Regularly review smart contract and frontend code for security issues.
