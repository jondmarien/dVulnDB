# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating DVulnDB from a multi-chain architecture (supporting both Solana and EVM chains) to a Solana-only implementation. The goal is to simplify the codebase, improve performance, and focus on Solanaadvantages including speed and proof-of-stake consensus. This migration will remove all Ethereum/EVM support while preserving all core functionality on Solana.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to connect my Phantom wallet and interact with DVulnDB on Solana only, so that I can benefit from faster transactions and lower fees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL only support Phantom wallet connections
2. WHEN a user attempts to connect a wallet THEN the system SHALL not display EVM wallet options
3. WHEN a user connects their Phantom wallet THEN the system SHALL interact exclusively with Solana blockchain
4. WHEN a user performs any blockchain operation THEN the system SHALL use Solana RPC endpoints only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be free of EVM-specific code and dependencies, so that the application is simpler to maintain and deploy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL not contain any Hardhat configuration files
2. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL not include EVM-specific libraries (wagmi, viem, ethers)
3. WHEN reviewing smart contracts THEN the system SHALL only contain Anchor/Solana programs
4. WHEN reviewing deployment scripts THEN the system SHALL only contain Solana deployment configurations
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL not reference any EVM contract addresses or ABIs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work seamlessly on Solana, so that I don't lose any features during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a vulnerability THEN the system SHALL store records on Solana blockchain
2. WHEN creating a bounty program THEN the system SHALL use Solana-based escrow contracts
3. WHEN validating vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL use Solana-based multi-signature validation
4. WHEN earning reputation THEN the system SHALL update reputation scores on Solana
5. WHEN viewing vulnerability records THEN the system SHALL retrieve data from Solana blockchain only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration and environment setup to reflect Solana-only architecture, so that deployment and development processes are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL only require Solana CLI and Anchor
2. WHEN configuring RPC endpoints THEN the system SHALL only include Solana RPC providers
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL only execute Solana/Anchor tests
4. WHEN deploying contracts THEN the system SHALL only deploy to Solana networks (devnet, testnet, mainnet)
5. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL reflect Solana-only architecture

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain the same user experience and interface, so that the migration is transparent to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL maintain the same UI components and layouts
2. WHEN performing wallet operations THEN the system SHALL provide the same user feedback and loading states
3. WHEN viewing transaction history THEN the system SHALL display Solana transaction hashes and links
4. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL show Solana-specific error messages
5. WHEN using mock mode THEN the system SHALL simulate Solana operations only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean removal of EVM-specific files and folders, so that the repository structure is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL not contain the `evm/` directory (to be removed completely)
2. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN the system SHALL not contain `hardhat.config.ts` or EVM deployment configs in the root
3. WHEN reviewing contract files THEN the system SHALL not contain Solidity `.sol` files outside of the `evm/` folder
4. WHEN reviewing test files THEN the system SHALL not contain EVM-specific test files in the root
5. WHEN reviewing backup files THEN the system SHALL clean up any EVM-related backup files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all EVM contract functionality to be properly ported to Solana Anchor programs, so that no functionality is lost during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the `anchor/` directory THEN the system SHALL contain equivalent Solana programs for all EVM contracts
2. WHEN comparing contract functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain the same business logic in Anchor programs
3. WHEN reviewing smart contract interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent Solana program interfaces
4. WHEN testing contract interactions THEN the system SHALL verify all EVM contract features work in Solana programs
5. WHEN deploying programs THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy all required Anchor programs to Solana networks
