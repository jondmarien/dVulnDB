# DVulnDB Security & Vulnerability Standards

## CVSS Implementation
- **CVSS 4.0 & 3.0 Support**: Full support for both versions of Common Vulnerability Scoring System
- **No Custom Scoring**: Only use official CVSS standards, never invent proprietary scoring
- **Vector Storage**: Store complete CVSS vectors on-chain for transparency
- **Score Calculation**: Use official CVSS calculators and libraries
- **Temporal Metrics**: Support temporal scoring for evolving vulnerabilities

## Blockchain-Specific Severity (Hacken Methodology)
- **Severity Matrix**: Use Hacken's exploitation difficulty vs access level matrix
- **CVSS Mapping**: Map blockchain severity to standard CVSS ranges:
  - **Critical**: 9.0-10.0 (Low difficulty, Significant access)
  - **High**: 7.0-8.9 (Low difficulty, Moderate access OR Medium difficulty, Significant access)
  - **Medium**: 4.0-6.9 (Medium difficulty, Moderate access OR High difficulty, Significant access)
  - **Low**: 0.1-3.9 (High difficulty, Low access OR easier exploitation with minimal impact)
  - **Informational**: No CVSS score (System insights, no immediate risk)

## Vulnerability Classification
- **OWASP Standards**: Use OWASP Top 10 and other established classifications
- **CWE Integration**: Map vulnerabilities to Common Weakness Enumeration
- **Blockchain-Specific**: Include DeFi, smart contract, and Web3-specific vulnerability types
- **Tool Integration**: Support outputs from Nmap, Nikto, Burp Suite, and custom scanners

## Evidence Requirements
- **Proof of Concept**: Require working PoC for all vulnerability submissions
- **IPFS Storage**: Store detailed reports and evidence on IPFS with on-chain hashes
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure vulnerabilities can be reproduced by validators
- **Impact Assessment**: Document actual vs potential impact clearly

## Responsible Disclosure
- **Time-locked Disclosure**: Implement time delays for public disclosure
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Support coordinated disclosure with affected parties
- **Grace Periods**: Provide reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- **Emergency Disclosure**: Fast-track process for critical vulnerabilities

## Validation Process
- **Multi-signature Validation**: Require multiple validators for bounty approval
- **Reputation-based Voting**: Weight validator votes by reputation and expertise
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear process for handling disputed validations
- **False Positive Handling**: Penalties for submitting invalid vulnerabilities

## Security Tool Integration
- **Automated Parsing**: Parse outputs from common security tools
- **Standardized Formats**: Support XML, JSON, and other standard report formats
- **Custom Integrations**: API endpoints for custom tool integrations
- **PowerShell Module**: Windows-specific integration for enterprise environments

## Data Integrity
- **Immutable Records**: Store vulnerability records immutably on blockchain
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain complete audit trails for all changes
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: Sign all submissions and validations
- **Version Control**: Track changes to vulnerability reports over time
